# ACA-Project

The aim of the algorithm is solving a maze which has some specific properties:
The maze must be extracted from a binary or greyscale image;
The maze must have only one entrance and one exit.
The maze must be a “perfect maze”, this means that only one path solves the labyrinth;

To reach the aim mentioned above the OpenCV library is used given that it provides optimised operations to deal with images and matrices.
